At Twovect, we believe the global community-based productivity, creativity, and inspiration provided by free and open-source software (FOSS) will be the driving force of future innovations. We hope to break down the barriers between developers and users, creating shared software that is truly for the better of humanity.

What we ARE:
:white_check_mark: A high-caliber cross-platform rendering and graphics system
:white_check_mark: Free and open-source, **always**.
:white_check_mark: An efficient community of dedicated contributors
:white_check_mark: Open to suggestions from anyone

What we AREN'T:
:x: For-profit, now or in the future
:x: An attempt to recreate or replace existing projects without originality
:x: Faint-hearted, even in the face of large projects
:x: Secretive, dogmatic, or makers of false promises
